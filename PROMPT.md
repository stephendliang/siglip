**Optimizing a Blackwell (SM100) GEMM epilogue for a SigLIP2 patch embedding kernel.** The kernel is warp-specialized (W0=TMA loads, W1=MMA, W2-5=epilogue) doing FP8×FP8→FP32→BF16 with fused bias+positional embedding add. The GEMM itself is fast (it is roughly similar to CUTLASS speeds and 75% of cuBLAS the gold standard); the epilogue is the bottleneck. Currently it uses TMA stores through SMEM (requiring `tma_store_fence`, `__syncwarp`, lane-0-only store issue, and `tma_store_wait`), a `__syncthreads` that couples all 6 warps at every tile boundary, and only 4 of 6 warps doing TMEM reads — wasting 33% of available interleaving depth on the ~200-cycle `tcgen05.ld` latency.

The reference point is SUPERIOR.cu pattern (described by the author at https://gau-nernst.github.io/tcgen05/), which already solved most of these problems: mbarrier-based decoupling instead of `__syncthreads`, `st.global.v8.b32` instead of TMA stores, and clean warp-specialized structure. The kernel currently copies the SUPERIOR mainloop structure but uses an inferior epilogue — essentially hand-rolled TMA store pipelining with double-buffered SMEM staging, when the reference code just does direct global stores. The gap is known and the fixes are largely "transplant patterns that already exist 200 lines away in the same repo."
